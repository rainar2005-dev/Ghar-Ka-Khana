# Ghar-Ka-Khana
Hi everyone! As part of my 2nd Year (4th Semester) Mini Project in Computer Engineering, my team and I worked together to design and develop a web-based application. Through this project, I learned how to apply theoretical concepts into practical implementation, collaborate effectively in a team, and understand real-world development workflows.

🚀 Mini Project Showcase – “Ghar Ka Khana” 🍱

Excited to share my mini project “Ghar Ka Khana”, a Django-based web application designed to connect customers with home-style food vendors.

The platform includes separate modules for customers and vendors, enabling smooth ordering, menu management, and delivery flow.

🔧 Tech Stack Used:
• Python
• Django
• HTML, CSS
• SQLite
• Django Templates

✨ Key Features:
• Customer & Vendor authentication
• Menu listing with images and descriptions
• Order placement & payment flow
• Vendor dashboard to manage orders
• Clean and responsive UI

📚 What I Learned:
• Django project structure & MVC architecture
• Backend logic with models, views & URLs
• Database handling using SQLite
• Full-stack development workflow

This project helped me gain strong hands-on experience in web development and backend integration.
Open to feedback and suggestions! 😊

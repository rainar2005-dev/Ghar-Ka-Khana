# Ghar-Ka-Khana
Hi everyone! As part of my 2nd Year (4th Semester) Mini Project in Computer Engineering, my team and I worked together to design and develop a web-based application. Through this project, I learned how to apply theoretical concepts into practical implementation, collaborate effectively in a team, and understand real-world development workflows.
